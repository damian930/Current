-- Memory
[] Add support for OS specific allocations (VAlloc, VRelease, VCommit). 
   Think about wether you want to have then the memory managment be a part of the os.
   You definately dont want to have to include os layer in the base layer where the arena shoud be. 
   Maybe then some macro stuff that is specified per os that is then using the arena from the base layer as well. 
   --
[] Try to see how the base layer arena can be made a non concrete implemention.
   Maybe make a layer (json parser for example) that is like stb, it lets the caller specify the types but they have to conform to an interface.
   This will allow you to see how malloc/free like api can be converted to an arena like api that then i used inside the lib. 
   See if this has to be a separate implementation then or if it has any effect on the base layer. 
   Base is the root of all the other things, so we dont want to make it bigger unless we need to.
   --
[] Implement cashe alignment for arena allocations (Ideally also test if it doesnt anything compared to the non aligned version)
   --
[] Implement a scratch space that can deal with conficts. It also has to be then able to deal with failure to fix those conflicts.
   One way is to have a fuct pointer or just a macro that then is used for arenas at specific ocasions, like when the arena is about to crash.
   We then might be able to control it, without having to make the signle code path in the real code sight bigger.
   What are some other possible ways of dealing with these things?
